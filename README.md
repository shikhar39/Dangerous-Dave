# Dangerous-Dave
This is my beginners attempt to recreate the classic game of Dangerous Dave from 1990.
I'll be using developing it in C++, using the SFML library.

Special thanks to youtuber Hilze Vonck https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8C7ncaMYnXyu-pRU0S9FLg from whom I learned to use and manage SFML into classes.
