# Dangerous-Dave
This is my beginners attempt to recreate the classic game of Dangerous Dave from 1990. I have made this for my personal learning purposes. If you are going through the project, I would highly appreciate people sending me notes on how I can imrpove my coding style or anything in General.
I'll be using developing it in C++, using the SFML library.

The target system should be an x64 based system. Project can be compiled using the visual studio solution file in the root directory of the repository. Some .dll files will be required to run the executables which can be found in /Project1/SFML/dependencies. You can copy paste them into the folder which has your executables.

For pre-built executables download it from this link. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YbFumFcRiegfdLbGqya-RezoEiGuyH6F?usp=sharing

Special thanks to youtuber Hilze Vonck https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8C7ncaMYnXyu-pRU0S9FLg from whom I learned to use and manage SFML into classes.
